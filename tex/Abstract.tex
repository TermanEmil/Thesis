The application was build using Python programming language. The tool consists from two components: camera communication and the client. The technologies used are Django framework for building the web api, SQL Server for storing the data, GPhoto2 for communicating with the cameras and Ykush for hard resetting.

DSLR Camera Controller represents a tool for photographers that want to take reliable long term time-lapses. It has the right tools to handle the camera settings, file transfer, camera failure strategy and time-lapse scheduling.
